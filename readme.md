In this [exercise](G_Text_Summarization_with_Transformer_model.ipynb), I implemented the decoder part of a simple transformer model for text summarization task, based on the starting code, instructions, and utility functions from the [Natural Language Processing with Attention Models](https://www.coursera.org/learn/attention-models-in-nlp) course (by DeepLearning.AI on Coursera).

Coursera starting code already handled text pre-processing as well as other parts of this Transformer model.

This exercise is mainly for learning and practice, so the text summarization result was not very accurate. The model can generate summaries that have at least some resemblance to the original paragraphs in the training data, but could not do the same with testing paragraphs. 

That shows that the transformer model was overfitting, given how big the transformer model was and how small Coursera's training data was. The model might be memorizing the summary sentences provided in the training data.

Example summaries from the training data:

Training set example:

jonas: i‚Äôm running 10 minutes late. could you guys just let mary know that i‚Äôm coming and will present today before she starts?  
natalie: sure no problem  
olivia: i‚Äôll save a seat for you üòç  
jonas: thanks so much. see you in a bit xx 

Summary generated by model:

[SOS] jonas is running late as she's running late for her present mary will let olivia know if he gets a bit late [EOS]

Training set example:

jade: are you going to that trip 
wayne: was  
jade: what do you mean  
wayne: its portponed  
jade: are you kidding me xd  
wayne: im serious, why surprised  
jade: i had to go home and miss it xd  
wayne: oh, cool you can make it when we go  jade: yea, yesss  
wayne: :d [EOS]


Summary generated by model:

[SOS] the trip wayne was going to go on was postponed now jade will be able to go to [EOS]

```

Training set example:

william: hey. today i saw you were arguing with blackett.  
william: are you guys fine?  
elizabeth: hi. sorry you had to see us argue.
elizabeth: it was just a small misunderstanding but we will solve it.  
william: hope so  william: you think i should to talk to him about it?  
elizabeth: no don't  
elizabeth: he won't like it that we talked after the argument.  
william: ok. but if you need any help, don't hesitate to call me  
elizabeth: definitely



Summary generated by model:

[SOS] elizabeth had a problem with blackett today but she doesn't want william to intermeddle [EOS]

```
